# FSB Cloud

Welcome to **FSB Cloud** â€“ a platform created by the students of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture (FSB) at the University of Zagreb. FSB Cloud is a **community-driven repository** for students to **upload**, **view**, and **share materials** such as **exams**, **notes**, **study guides**, and **projects**. Our goal is to build a collaborative, open-source platform that enhances the learning experience for all FSB students.

## About the Project

- **Collaborative sharing**: Foster a community of learners helping each other.

This platform is built using modern web technologies and aims to be a central hub for all student resources.

## Features

- **File Viewing**: Preview documents like PDFs or images without downloading.
- **Search**: Quickly find materials using a robust search feature.
- **Login and User Authentication**: Required to upload or contribute materials.
