# FSB Cloud

Welcome to **FSB Cloud** â€“ a platform created by the students of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture (FSB) at the University of Zagreb. FSB Cloud is a **community-driven repository** for students to **upload**, **view**, and **share materials** such as **exams**, **notes**, **study guides**, and **projects**. Our goal is to build a collaborative, open-source platform that enhances the learning experience for all FSB students.

## About the Project

FSB Cloud is designed to make learning materials easily accessible to all FSB students, especially those in higher years, who have accumulated valuable resources. The platform will provide features for:
- **Uploading study materials**: Students can contribute their notes, past exams, and other resources.
- **Viewing shared materials**: Access documents and materials uploaded by others.
- **Collaborative sharing**: Foster a community of learners helping each other.

This platform is built using modern web technologies and aims to be a central hub for all student resources.

## Features

- **File Uploading**: Simple and intuitive interface to upload materials.
- **File Viewing**: Preview documents like PDFs or images without downloading.
- **Search**: Quickly find materials using a robust search feature.
- **Login and User Authentication**: Required to upload or contribute materials.
- **Material Management**: Ability to sort and organize materials by subject, year, and type.
